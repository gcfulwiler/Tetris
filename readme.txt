Left-Move block left
Right-Move block right
Up-Rotate block
Down-Speed up block's movement

Gameplay:
Move each block around the board as it falls until it locks in place on the bottom. Once it hits the bottom, another block will spawn. The goal is to clear lines by completing a horizontal line so that the blocks don't reach the top. Once the peices get too high, the game is over.

Scoring System:
You receive points for moving the blocks to the bottom faster as well as clearing lines

Level System:
You advance levels each time you clear another 10 lines from the board
